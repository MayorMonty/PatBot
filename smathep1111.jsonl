{"prompt":"ok how do i get user input in assembly <:hmm:936055975964717086>","completion":"Getting user input in assembly depends on the particular system or platform that you are working on, as well as the specific method of input you want to use. Here is a general overview of how you might get user input using standard input (stdin) on a Unix-based system:\n\n1. Use a system call to allocate memory for the input buffer. You can use the brk() or sbrk() system call to increase the size of the data segment.\n2. Use the read() system call to read input from the user into the buffer you just allocated. The read() system call takes three arguments: the file descriptor of the input source (in this case, 0 for stdin), the address of the buffer to read into, and the maximum number of bytes to read.\n3. After the user enters input, it will be stored in the buffer you allocated. You can then process the input and perform any necessary operations on it.\n4. Once you are done processing the input, you can free the memory allocated for the buffer using the brk() or sbrk() system call.\n\nHere is an example implementation in x86 assembly:\n```as\nsection .data\ninput_buffer db 100        ; allocate 100 bytes for the input buffer\nsection .text\nglobal _start\n_start:\n    ; allocate memory for the input buffer\n    mov eax, 45         ; use the brk() system call\n    mov ebx, input_buffer\n    int 0x80\n\n    ; read input from the user\n    mov eax, 3          ; use the read() system call\n    mov ebx, 0          ; stdin file descriptor\n    mov ecx, input_buffer    ; address of the buffer\n    mov edx, 100        ; maximum number of bytes to read\n    int 0x80\n\n    ; process the input\n    ; ...\n\n    ; free the memory allocated for the input buffer\n    mov eax, 45         ; use the brk() system call\n    mov ebx, input_buffer\n    neg ebx             ; set ebx to the negative value of the buffer address\n    int 0x80\n\n    ; exit the program\n    mov eax, 1\n    xor ebx, ebx\n    int 0x80\n```"}

{"prompt":"Dear fellow members of the CPSC Discord,\n\nOn this Valentine's Day, I want to express my appreciation for our shared passion for algorithms. As we all know, algorithms are like love - they can be complex and nuanced, and they can bring both joy and frustration. But unlike love, algorithms always have a rational and logical explanation behind them.\n\nIt is truly a delight to engage with all of you in our discussions, debates, and problem-solving sessions on various algorithmic challenges. Your enthusiasm for the subject is infectious, and your analytical minds never cease to amaze me. Whether we're discussing sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, or graph algorithms, I always learn something new and valuable from our interactions.\n\nI may not be expressing romantic love in this letter, but I believe that the intellectual connection we share is just as important and fulfilling. I hope that we can continue to support and challenge each other in our pursuit of understanding and mastery of algorithms, and that our friendship continues to grow and prosper.\n\nThank you for being such great algorithmic companions and for making this Discord community such a welcoming and engaging place. Happy Valentine's Day, my dear friends!\n\nYours truly,\n\n<@299741583828451328>","completion":"Thanks ~~ChatG-~~ Michael <:peeposit:892945656359030834>"}

Credit can determine if you can a nice apartment or house, a car (if not buying in full), and some jobs may do a credit pull. \nAlso, it keeps your cash safe in case your credit card number gets stolen. Your cash isn‚Äôt lost and you aren‚Äôt liable for fraud (as long as you report it quick). If your debit card number is stolen, your cash is at risk. \nThere are also perks, like cash back, rewards, extended warranty, etc. \nIt‚Äôs also good if like you need to buy something between paychecks, but are low on cash or your checking account is low"}

This modified version of the algorithm would start at the source node and explore the graph, adding the cost of each edge to a running total as it goes. When the total cost reaches the step limit, the algorithm would stop and return the maximum cost that it has found so far.\n\nIt's worth noting that this modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm may not always find the maximum cost within the step limit, as it may not have explored all of the possible paths in the graph before it reached the step limit. However, it can provide a good approximation of the maximum cost within the given step limit, and can be useful for certain types of problems."}

Now, these aren‚Äôt necessarily the vibes you have on a Thursday afternoon, or the vibes you have *with* a Thursday afternoon, or the vibes you typically associate with Thursday afternoon.

There‚Äôs nothing particularly special about them, they just are. Nothing is special about a Friday or a Monday or a Saturday or a Sunday. The relative associations with these days and their vibes are all completely societal and therefore are false.\n\nNever is the social construction of time more apparent than on a Thursday afternoon. Thursday afternoons just are, you see. They do not hold the tantalizing promise of the weekend, they do not signify a new beginning, they simply exist. They are the most pure form of existence because they aren‚Äôt necessarily clearly defined, they just come and go. You pass through them without necessarily noting anything special about the vibe itself, because there isn‚Äôt anything special.\n\nThis being said, Thursday afternoons are pure, unfiltered existence. They have no stresses or associations, they just happen, they come and go without note. They are the most primal and human-free version of time, they are ancient, they are timeless.
